The DataFrame and Series:
The DataFrame and Series are the two primary pandas objects that we will be using throughout this book.
DataFrame - A two-dimensional data structure that looks like any other rectangular table of data you have seen with rows and columns.
Series - A single dimension of data. It is analogous to a single column of data or a one dimensional array.
